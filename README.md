This repository serves as a study guide and roadmap for the **Java Foundations (1Z0-811)** certification, containing practical examples of fundamental language concepts.

## Java Features

* Object-oriented
* Distributed
* Robust
* Secure
* System Independence
* Portability
* Interpreted
* High Performance
* Multithreaded
* Dynamic
* Strongly-Typed

## Prerequisites

The project is configured to use **Java 11** (JDK 11).
Ensure you have JDK 11 or a higher version installed to compile and run the examples.

## How to Run the Project

This project does not have a single complex entry point. It is structured so that each class can be studied and executed individually, focusing on specific topics.

To run the examples:

1. Open the project in your favorite IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).
2. Navigate to the `src` folder.
3. Choose the `.java` file corresponding to the topic you want to study (e.g., `Arrays.java`, `Main.java`).
4. Run the file individually.

If using **IntelliJ IDEA**:
* Open the desired file.
* Click the green "Play" icon next to the `main` method or right-click the file and select `Run 'ClassName.main()'`.

If using the **Terminal**:
Compile and run the desired class from the project root:

```bash
# Example to run Main.java
javac -d out src/Main.java
java -cp out Main
```
